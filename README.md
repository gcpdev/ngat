This is a prototype authoring tool for creating Domain Models, based on the GAT (GRAPPLE Authoring Tool) created to support my Master Thesis. 

It was designed to support cross-platform devices, and so it was built with jQuery and HTML5 technologies, and using the cytoscape.js open-source library.

In case of need, feel free to contact at gpublio at gmail and I'll answer you as soon as possible.
